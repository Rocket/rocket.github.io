GNU Rocket is a multi-purpose modular rocket control system. Among its features cross-platform support, a warhead plugin interface and support for fully standards-compliant remote navigation protocols.

GNU Rocket is managed and developed by the GNU Rocket Software Foundation. The GNU Rocket Software Foundation provides support for the GNU Rocket community of open-source software projects. The GNU Rocket projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus based development process, an open and pragmatic software license, and a desire to create high quality software that leads the way in its field. We consider ourselves not simply a group of projects sharing a server, but rather a community of developers and users.

For now the website is still under development, but do know that most of our attention will fly out to developing the software for now. For the near future please visit our [GitHub Page](https://github.com/rocket/rocket) for updates.
